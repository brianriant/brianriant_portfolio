## 📍 The Process

Building a portfolio is always a journey of showing who you are through code. I wanted something that felt personal but professional, with animations that enhance rather than distract. Started with Next.js for its excellent routing and optimization features, then layered in Motion to bring life to the page transitions and component reveals. The dark mode was a must-have, and I made sure it persists across sessions. Added a blog system to share my thoughts on development, keeping it simple with markdown files. The whole thing is built with reusable components, making it easy to update and maintain as I grow.
