State management is a critical aspect of building scalable React applications. React provides several ways to manage state, each with its own advantages and use cases.

In this post, we'll explore the core state management techniques, from using the built-in useState and useReducer hooks for local component state to using the Context API for global state management. We'll then dive into more advanced solutions like Redux Toolkit and Zustand, comparing their strengths, use cases, and best practices.

Additionally, we'll discuss performance optimizations, such as memoization and state normalization, to prevent unnecessary re-renders. By the end, you'll have a clear roadmap for managing state effectively in your React projects, ensuring better maintainability and performance.
