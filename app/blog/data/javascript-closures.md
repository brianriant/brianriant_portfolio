Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to retain access to variables from their parent scope even after the parent function has finished execution. They play a crucial role in JavaScript, especially when dealing with asynchronous code, event handlers, and data encapsulation.

In this blog, we'll explore closures in depth, starting with their definition and how they work under the hood. We'll then move on to practical examples, including how closures help in creating private variables, function factories, and memoization.

By the end of this post, you'll have a deep understanding of closures and their real-world applications, making your JavaScript code more efficient and modular.
